        <p>
          We provide a Platform for Users &ndash; individuals, entities, nonprofit
          organizations, etc. &ndash; to create &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; or calls
          to action to bring attention to social campaigns, programs, and
          fund-raising efforts (&ldquo;Causes&rdquo;). Through Move the Chain,
          Users may pledge and make payment on donations to nonprofit
          organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Causes must be created on behalf of nonprofit organizations,
          established as such under the applicable jurisdictional laws
          (hereinafter: Beneficiaries). All United States Beneficiaries must be
          either a 501(c)(3), (C)(4), or other nonprofit organization with the
          purpose of accepting funds for charitable purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Move the Chain does not act as and is not a Broker, Financial
          Institution, Creditor or nonprofit organization. We provide the
          technology for the creation of Causes and awareness between Users and
          their selected Causes. We may accept a Platform fee for the services
          rendered associated with the Causes. You acknowledge that facilitation
          is integral to the Services offered and that all personal and other
          types of information collected to enable our Services are dictated by

        <h3 className="text-32px">Nonprofit Organizations</h3>
        <p>
          We partner with PayPal Giving Fund (&ldquo;PPGF&rdquo;) to recommend
          nonprofit organizations to support. We access a database maintained by
          PPGF of nonprofit organizations participating in PPGF&rsquo;s programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          PPGF is a grant-giving IRS-registered 501(c)(3) public charity (Federal
          Tax ID: 45-0931286) that aims to inspire a new wave of philanthropy by
          making giving part of everyday life. PPGF is the receiving charity of
          record for any donation made through its programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          PPGF ensures all charities have met the eligibility requirements in the&nbsp;

          PPGF grants funds to charities by reviewing their&nbsp;

          . We are not responsible to validate the legitimacy and/or status of the
          nonprofit organizations included in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a donor, you should get a tax receipt from PPGF for each
          tax-deductible donation you make. PPGF sends tax receipts to donors by
          email.
        </p>
        <p>Donation Processing</p>
        <p>
          We partner with PPGF to ensure your charitable donations benefit the
          nonprofit organizations of your choice. PPGF receives donations from
          Users as charity of record on our Platform and provides you with the
          donation receipt. PPGF then grants the funds to the nonprofit you
          recommended on our Platform, subject to its&nbsp;
          <a className="text-blue-500 font-bold" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/givingfund/policies/donor-terms-of-service&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615498882088000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3UR2miyFLDNjrYwj81FA6A">
            terms
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Donations are subject to PayPal&rsquo;s payment processing fees, and
          PPGF makes grants to benefitting charities net of those fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether a charity is enrolled in PPGF determines the method and speed at
          which funds are granted. Pending distribution of grants, PPGF holds all
          donations in a secure, non-interest bearing bank account. The charity
          you recommend will typically receive the funds within 15-45 days of your
          original donation, or within 90 days if the charity has not enrolled
          with PPGF.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but if, after reasonable efforts, PPGF
          cannot deliver donations to the charity you recommend, it will whenever
          possible seek a new recommendation from you, and if no recommendation is
          given, will reassign the funds to another charity, which has been vetted
          by PPGF.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-32px">Refunds and Chargebacks</h3>
        <p>
          All refunds for Causes are handled by us. We are responsible for
          handling or communicating the refund policy and work with our payment
          processor to process the refunds. Donations processed are not typically
          refundable. In exceptional circumstances, you may be able
          to&nbsp;request a refund&nbsp;up to 60 days after the donation date,
          subject to PayPal Giving Fund&rsquo;s&nbsp;

          &nbsp;and provided that the funds have not already been granted to your
          chosen charity. The donation amount less the processing fee will be
          returned to the Donor. Donations older than 60 days will not be
          refunded.

          someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property rights. Move the Chain has

          can be accessed for use on the Platform:

          make sure that what you post to the Platform doesn&rsquo;t violate

          OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN
          ARBITRATION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE

        </p>
        <h3 className="text-32px">Arbitration Process</h3>
        <p>
          Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the Federal
          Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association
          (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,
          &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) as modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA
          Rules and filing forms are available online at&nbsp;
          <a className="text-blue-500 font-bold" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615498882105000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1c-unfEvYOFjvhRABw33LU">
            www.adr.org
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
          of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal
          Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not
          provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail
          (&ldquo;Notice of Arbitration&rdquo;). Our current address for Notice
          is: Move the Chain, Inc., 138 W Hill Road, Stamford, CT, 06902. The
          Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the
          claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
          (&ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). We agree to work with you and make a good faith
          effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we aren&rsquo;t successful
          within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or we
          may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings
          between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the
          parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
          offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
          after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
          arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written
          settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to
          the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by
          the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.00.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-32px">Fees</h3>
        <p>
          If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Use, we
          will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim
          is for more than $10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be
          decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at an
          agreed upon location in Stamford, Connecticut, but if the claim is for
          $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
          conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
          arbitrator; (b) through a telephone hearing or (c) by an in-person
          hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing
          address. If the arbitration finds that either the substance of your
          claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
          improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal
          Rule of Civil procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be
          governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for
          all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation
          to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
          arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written
          decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
          which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make
          rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees
          or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from
          either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the
          merits.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-32px">Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
          is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
          is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
          representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
          persons.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-32px">Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
          seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
          intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
          arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
          unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
          provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
          will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
          provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
          decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed
          for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
          jurisdiction of that court.
